The use of flow cytometry for common blood analysis in developing countries and field laboratories is problematic due to the high cost of the equipment, limited access to servicing and unreliable power. As an alternative to this technique we are developping a deep-learning AI powered microscope for analysis of blood and other samples.

Manual microscopy has served as a bedrock for many modern diagnostics, including diagnosing diseases such as Malaria. Direct visual identification of blood cells remains the gold standard for numerous diseases. However, this comes at the cost of tedious labor and human errors. Human fatigue has been identified as a crucial factor in reduced efficiency in microscopy based diagnostics. The same technological advancements that will one day lead to self-driving cars is currently mature enough to take over this task.

Based on the openflexure robotic microscope, we are developing a low-cost 3D printable autonomous platform capable of counting blood cell types and detecting parasite infections through the application of machine-learning. The device allows screening of more than 1.5 million red blood cells per minute for infections, which is 120 times faster compared to traditional manual microscopy. The cost of constructing the mini hematology lab is expected to be around 300 USD.

The microscope is based on the [OpenFlexure](https://openflexure.org/) project started by Richard Bowman and maintained by the Bath Open INstrumentation Group.

The microscope is being extended for field and automated diagnostic use by the [WoIdMo](https://woidmo.org).
